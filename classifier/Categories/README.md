This folder contains all the words used to categorize commits. Associated words with commits are expected to be comma-separated and lower case.
Keywords composed of multiple words that allow non-keywords between them can be expressed using "...". For example, if a keyword requires both the words "repair" and "bug" to appear in the commit message, but other words are allowed to be between them (e.g., "repair pop-up bug"), the keyword can be expressed as "repair...bug".
Chinese characters are also allowed.
